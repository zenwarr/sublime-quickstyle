# Sublime QuickStyle

Open HTML and CSS files, position cursor at class name and select "Add rule from class name " in command palette. Now generated rule will be inserted in the opened CSS file view at the point where cursor is located.

Supports plain CSS as well as SCSS (regular and indented syntax), LESS and Stylus. By default, generates rules for Stylus in indented syntax, but you can override this by setting "stylus_use_indented" to false in quickstyle.sublime-settings file.
